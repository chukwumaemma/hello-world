# hello-world
I represent the Nigerian Biodiversity Information Facility (NgBIF)

I am a taxonomist and currently with the National Herbarium Ibadan (FHI). I have been involved in GBIF activities in the last 6 years and have conviniently utilized the avalable resources or tools in publishing Nigerian biodiversiy data including checklists and occurence records, via NgBIF's IPT.
